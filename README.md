# Wine
Exploratory Data Analysis — Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree

## Summary

This project reveals the link between the components (input variables) of wine samples and its final taste, evaluated by experts. In other words, it will help uncover the hidden recipe for the perfect wine making.

The data set consists of 1599 observations and 12 variables (13 if you count X, which is merely a numeration). 11 of them are input variables, measurements from each wine sample. The last one is the output variable, a score between 1 and 10, that measures the wine quality determined by each critic.

## Files
